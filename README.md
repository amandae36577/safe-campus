# safeCampus
This application was designed and developed in 20 hours. Therefore, it is the base functionalities to demonstrate the idea.

### Overview
In an emergency, this app will allow students to contact campus police and contacts of thier choice instantly with their real-time location by utilizing AWS SMS service. It was created to allow students to feel safe while walking back from class late at night.

### Next Steps
1. **Remember me option** or **Stay Logged In** for login. I want our users to have the easiest access to the alert button and not have to login if they are in a scary situation.
2. **Updated Button Type**. My design team decided to make the button a press and hold to avoid accidental pressing in a pocket. A better design would be a slide button so the user does not have to wait for activation.
3. **Multiple Alert Types**. I want our users to have the ability to alert campus police of different types of saftey issues through one interface. The main one would still be a general alert button, but with the possibility to have smaller alert buttons for example: school shooter, or fire.
